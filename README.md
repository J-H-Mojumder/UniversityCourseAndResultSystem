This is a University course and result management system. Here we can organize University’s course related tasks like allocating rooms, tracking student’s results, course enrollments etc. Functionalities:
1.	Creating new departments
2.	New courses
3.	New teachers
4.	Allocate classrooms
5.	Register students and enroll courses
6.	Save students result and view them
7.	Unassign all classrooms and all courses
I have used MVC (Model-view-controller) model here to develop the system. So, codes are pretty organized and easy to work with. There are 3 folders named ‘models’, ‘views’ and ‘controllers’.
**Models** contains all the data object structures and all the declarations and definitions. That means all classes are defined in this folder.
**Views** contains all the views. Views are the format through which we can see all our data of the DOM.
**Controllers** contains all the files which controls the requests form the users and manipulates the DOM accordingly and also redirects to the views.
**Images** contain all the images of the project.
**DAL** stands for **Data Access Layer**. In this folder we have files to access data of the database.
**BLL** stands for **Business Logic Layer**. Here we have logics which are necessary for business models. These will vary in every project based on requirements of a business.

It’s an old project of mine, done back in 2019. Hope it will help people out there a bit.
Happy coding
